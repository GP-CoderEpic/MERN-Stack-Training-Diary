# 🚀 MERN Stack Training Diary

## Day 1 - 23 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Introduction to MongoDB, MongoDB Compass installation, understanding NoSQL databases, basic database and collection creation

### 💻 What I Did:
Today marked the beginning of my MERN Stack training, and I started by diving into **MongoDB**, which is the database part of the stack. I learned that MongoDB is a **NoSQL database**, which means it stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called **documents**, grouped into **collections**.

I installed **MongoDB Compass**, a GUI tool provided by MongoDB, which makes it easy to create and view databases and documents without writing any code. I also installed MongoDB locally and verified that it was running on my system.

Using Compass, I created my first database called `studentsDB` and added a collection named `students`. I inserted some documents manually to understand the structure.

Here's an example of the document I inserted:
```json
{
  "name": "Gaurav",
  "age": 20,
  "email": "gaurav@example.com",
  "course": "MERN Stack"
}
```
I also explored the concept of schema-less databases, where we don't need to define tables or columns beforehand. This felt very flexible compared to SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### 🧠 Reflections:
The flexibility of MongoDB was quite surprising and refreshing. I didn't need to worry about creating a strict schema or defining data types upfront. The Compass interface made it very intuitive to insert and view data. As someone used to SQL, working with a document-based model opened a new perspective for me. I'm looking forward to writing queries and connecting MongoDB with Node.js soon. Overall, a strong and promising start to the training!

## Day 2 - 24 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
MongoDB CRUD operations – insertOne, insertMany, find, findOne, deleteOne; running queries in Compass and shell

### 💻 What I Did:
Today I learned and practiced the core **CRUD operations** in MongoDB – **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** – which are fundamental for any database interaction. I used both **MongoDB Compass** and the **Mongo shell** to perform these operations, and it gave me a better understanding of how data is manipulated behind the scenes.

Here’s what I practiced:

1. **Inserting a single document:**
```js
db.students.insertOne({
  name: "Priya",
  age: 22,
  email: "priya@example.com",
  course: "Full Stack"
});
```

2. **Inserting multiple documents:**
```js
db.students.insertMany([
  { name: "Ravi", age: 20, course: "React" },
  { name: "Anjali", age: 23, course: "Node.js" }
]);
```

3. **Finding documents:**
```js
db.students.find();  // Fetches all documents

db.students.findOne({ name: "Priya" });  // Fetches first match only
```

4. **Using conditions in find queries:**
```js
db.students.find({ age: { $gt: 21 } });  // Students older than 21
```

5. **Deleting a document:**
```js
db.students.deleteOne({ name: "Ravi" });
```

I practiced writing queries in both Compass and the shell. While Compass is very beginner-friendly, writing queries manually in the shell gave me a more “developer-like” feel and improved my confidence.

### 🧠 Reflections:
Today's hands-on practice with CRUD operations helped me build a solid foundation in MongoDB. Understanding how to manipulate data efficiently is essential for building real-world apps. It was especially exciting to filter results using conditions like `$gt` (greater than) and to insert multiple documents at once. I'm now comfortable creating and managing data collections, and I’m ready to connect MongoDB to backend logic in the next sessions!



---

## Day 3 - 25 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Using MongoDB with VS Code, Mongo shell commands, creating and running database scripts from .js files

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I focused on running MongoDB directly from **VS Code** and using the **Mongo shell** more efficiently. I learned how to create `.js` files containing multiple MongoDB commands and execute them via the terminal or shell.

To begin, I created a new JavaScript file called `script.js` in VS Code and added the following commands:
```js
db = connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/studentsDB");

db.students.insertMany([
  { name: "Neha", age: 24, course: "MongoDB" },
  { name: "Arjun", age: 21, course: "Node.js" }
]);

printjson(db.students.findOne({ name: "Neha" }));
```

Then I ran it using the terminal:
```bash
mongo < script.js
```

This allowed me to **automate multiple operations** in one go, which is more efficient than typing them one by one in the shell. I also explored Mongo shell commands like `show dbs`, `use`, and `show collections`.

In addition, I practiced writing queries with operators like `$lt`, `$gte`, and using logical queries:
```js
db.students.find({ age: { $gte: 21, $lte: 24 } });
```

VS Code provided a better development environment because of syntax highlighting and the ability to save/edit scripts easily.

### 🧠 Reflections:
Running MongoDB logic from a file felt like real programming. It made me realize how useful scripting is in development, especially for repetitive tasks or for database seeding. Learning to use the shell and VS Code together gave me more control and flexibility. I'm starting to enjoy working with databases, and I now understand why developers automate operations using scripts.


---

## Day 4 - 26 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Advanced MongoDB Queries – Projections, Field Filtering, and Script Automation

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I went deeper into MongoDB and explored **projections**, which allow us to control which fields are returned in the output of a query. Instead of getting all the data, we can include or exclude only the fields we care about.

For example:
```js
// Show only 'name' and hide '_id'
db.users.find({}, { name: 1, _id: 0 });
```

This is incredibly useful when we want to limit the amount of data transferred or focus on only relevant fields for UI display or analytics.

---

I also practiced **writing reusable MongoDB scripts** in `.js` files. Instead of typing one command at a time in the shell, I can now:
- Store all the logic in a `.js` file
- Run the whole script in one command using the shell

Example:
```js
// mongoScript.js
db = connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/library");

db.books.insertMany([
  { title: "Atomic Habits", author: "James Clear", price: 450 },
  { title: "Ikigai", author: "Francesc Miralles", price: 299 }
]);

db.books.find({}, { title: 1, _id: 0 });
```

To execute it:
```bash
mongo < mongoScript.js
```

This helped me understand the importance of **batch operations** and how databases can be automated just like code.

I also explored:
- How to **filter** data based on multiple conditions
- Using operators like `$or`, `$in`, `$lt`, `$gte` in combination

Example:
```js
db.books.find({
  $or: [
    { price: { $lt: 300 } },
    { author: "James Clear" }
  ]
});
```

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Learning about projections made it clearer how to work with data efficiently. I realized that it's not always about storing or retrieving everything — sometimes it's about getting just enough. Also, writing Mongo scripts helped me see MongoDB more like a programming tool rather than just a query terminal. This feels like a powerful way to prepare for real-world applications, especially when working with APIs or backend logic.



---

## Day 5 - 27 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Setting Up Express.js – Building REST APIs and Handling Requests

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I shifted focus to **Express.js**, the most popular web framework built on top of Node.js. I learned how to set up a basic Express application and how to run it locally using `node` or `nodemon`.

My first goal was to understand how to create a basic server. I wrote this simple code to get started:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Running this script in the terminal served my app on `http://localhost:3000`, and visiting that in the browser showed the welcome message. This was the first time I saw my Node.js code respond through a browser — an exciting moment!

---

### 🌐 Handling Different Request Types:
I also explored different HTTP methods and how to handle them:
- `GET` – fetch data
- `POST` – send new data
- `PUT/PATCH` – update existing data
- `DELETE` – remove data

Here’s an example I created to handle both GET and POST:
```js
app.get('/students', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of all students');
});

app.post('/students', (req, res) => {
  res.send('New student added');
});
```

To test these routes, I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) — a handy tool for testing APIs — and confirmed that the routes work as expected.

---

### 📦 Body Parser and Middleware:
I learned that Express can use **middleware** to modify request/response behavior. One common example is parsing JSON body data from `POST` requests:
```js
app.use(express.json());
```

This line lets me read data sent in the body like:
```json
{
  "name": "Riya",
  "age": 22
}
```

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Today gave me a practical understanding of how backend APIs work. I began to think in terms of **routes**, **methods**, and **responses**, and realized how essential Express is in building the logic layer of web apps. It's lightweight, flexible, and easy to start with — which makes it perfect for scaling from a small test API to a production-ready backend.


---

## Day 6 – 28 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Exploring Middleware, Route Parameters, and Modular Routing in Express.js

### 💻 What I Did:
Today’s session was packed with new Express.js features that make the backend more powerful and structured. I started by diving deeper into **middleware**, which acts as a bridge between the request and response cycle.

---

### 🧱 Custom Middleware:
I wrote a custom middleware to log request information:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request received at ${req.url}`);
  next(); // continue to the route handler
});
```

This really helped me understand how requests pass through layers before reaching the final route handler. It also made debugging and tracking much easier.

---

### 📦 Route Parameters:
I also explored **dynamic routing** using route parameters. Here's what I implemented:
```js
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});
```

This allowed me to fetch the dynamic `id` from the URL (e.g., `/users/101`) and use it in logic. Route parameters will be super helpful when building REST APIs with unique identifiers for users, products, posts, etc.

---

### 📁 Modular Routing:
As applications grow, routing can get messy in one file. I learned how to create **separate route modules** for cleaner code:
#### `routes/student.js`:
```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('All students');
});

router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Student ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```
#### `server.js`:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const studentRoutes = require('./routes/student');

app.use('/students', studentRoutes);
```

This gave my app a professional structure and made it easy to maintain multiple routes across different files.

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Understanding how to structure large apps and use features like middleware and modular routing is a game-changer. It felt like I went from writing a simple script to designing an actual backend system.

I'm starting to see how Express can scale — whether for small projects or production-grade systems. These practices will definitely help me as I continue building the backend for MERN stack apps.



---

## Day 7 – 30 June 2025
### 📌 Topics Covered:
HTTP Status Codes, Postman Testing, and Express Error Handling

### 💻 What I Did:
Today’s focus was on **testing backend APIs** more effectively and handling different types of server responses. I deepened my understanding of how the backend communicates with the client using **HTTP status codes**, and how to **test APIs with Postman**.

---

### 🌐 HTTP Status Codes:
I explored the most commonly used status codes in Express:
- `200 OK` – Success
- `201 Created` – Resource created successfully
- `400 Bad Request` – Client sent incorrect input
- `401 Unauthorized` – User is not authenticated
- `404 Not Found` – Resource doesn't exist
- `500 Internal Server Error` – Something went wrong on the server

Used them like this:
```js
app.get('/api/test', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('API is working fine!');
});
```

This helped me communicate more clearly with the frontend by sending the appropriate status codes based on the response logic.

---

### 🔁 Postman Testing:
I tested multiple GET and POST routes using **Postman**:
- Sent JSON data via `POST` requests
- Observed headers and body of responses
- Simulated failed requests to trigger error handling

This made it super easy to interact with APIs without writing frontend code.

---

### ⚠️ Error Handling:
Learned how to use **Express error middleware** to manage exceptions gracefully:
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Something went wrong!' });
});
```

This centralized the error management process so I didn’t need to duplicate try-catch logic everywhere.

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Postman became an essential tool for me today. I realized how crucial status codes and error messages are in building real-world applications. Error handling is not just about catching bugs — it’s about making the app stable and developer-friendly.

I'm starting to feel more confident interacting with APIs and simulating frontend scenarios. The more I test, the clearer things become.

---

✅ **Next Goal:** Implement request validation and explore `dotenv` for environment configs.



---

## Day 8 – 2 July 2025  
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Environment Variables with dotenv, Express Middleware Deep Dive, and Route Separation

### 💻 What I Did:
Today, I learned how to better structure and secure my backend code. I focused on using **environment variables**, creating **modular Express route files**, and understanding the **power of middleware** in Express.

---

### 🔐 dotenv – Environment Configuration:
I installed the `dotenv` package to manage sensitive data like database URLs, ports, and secret keys. This allowed me to separate configuration from code:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```
Then, I created a `.env` file:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

In my code, I used:
```js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

This is a best practice that keeps secrets safe and allows configuration changes without modifying the codebase.

---

### 🧱 Express Middleware:
I learned that middleware functions are executed in sequence and can:
- Modify the `req` and `res` objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware using `next()`

I created a custom logger middleware like this:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```

Also used `express.json()` to parse JSON payloads and `express.static()` to serve static files.

---

### 📁 Route Separation:
To keep my code cleaner, I moved all route logic into separate files:
```js
// routes/userRoutes.js
import express from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('User route is working');
});

export default router;
```

Then used it in my main app:
```js
import userRoutes from './routes/userRoutes.js';
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
```

This made my project modular and easier to scale.

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Today was about writing cleaner, scalable, and more secure backend code. Understanding how to manage environments and separate logic into different files is key for team collaboration and production-readiness.

I’m beginning to feel more like a real-world developer now—building not just "working code," but **maintainable code**.

---

✅ **Next Goal:** Learn file uploads using `multer` and secure user routes using JWT authentication.



---

## Day 9 – 3 July 2025  
### 📌 Topics Covered:
Multer for File Uploads, Handling Multipart Forms, and Basic Image Storage

### 💻 What I Did:
Today was all about enabling file uploads in my Node.js backend using the powerful middleware library **Multer**. I learned how to accept files like images and PDFs through API routes and store them on the local server.

---

### 📦 Installing Multer:
First, I installed Multer:
```bash
npm install multer
```

Then configured it in my server:
```js
import multer from 'multer';

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });
```

This allowed me to control **where** and **how** files are stored.

---

### 📤 Creating a File Upload Route:
I created a POST route to handle image uploads:
```js
app.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.file);  // Access uploaded file info
  res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
});
```

Used `upload.single('image')` for single file and `upload.array('photos', 5)` for multiple uploads.

---

### 🧪 Testing:
I tested the route using **Postman**:
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/upload`
- Body: `form-data` with `key = image`, type = file

It worked! The image was saved in the `/uploads` folder.

---

### 🔐 Validating File Type:
To enhance security, I added file type checks:
```js
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed!'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({ storage, fileFilter });
```

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
Before today, file uploads always seemed complex. But with Multer, it feels straightforward and reliable. I now understand how form-data is handled on the backend and how to store files in a structured, secure way.

This opens the door for future features like profile pictures, product galleries, and document uploads in full-stack apps.

---

✅ **Next Goal:** Start building authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for login-protected routes.



---

## 📅 Day 10 - Exploring Middleware and Route Handling in Express (July 4, 2025)

Today was all about deepening my understanding of how **Express.js** handles HTTP requests and how to structure middleware and routes in a modular and scalable way.

---

### 🔍 Topics Covered:
- Route-level vs application-level middleware
- Middleware chaining and execution order
- Custom validation middleware for route parameters
- Error handling middleware for specific route groups
- Advanced middleware patterns for authentication and logging

---

### 🧪 Practical Experiments:
- **Route-level middleware** that applies only to specific routes:
  ```js
  const validateUser = (req, res, next) => {
    const { id } = req.params;
    if (!id || isNaN(id)) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid user ID' });
    }
    next();
  };
  
  router.get('/users/:id', validateUser, (req, res) => {
    res.json({ userId: req.params.id });
  });
  ```

- **Middleware chaining** for authentication and logging:
  ```js
  app.get('/protected', authenticateUser, logActivity, (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Protected data' });
  });
  ```

- **Error handling middleware** for different route groups:
  ```js
  router.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    if (err.type === 'validation') {
      res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
    } else {
      next(err);
    }
  });
  ```

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Route-level middleware provides more granular control than application-level middleware
- Middleware chaining allows complex validation and processing workflows
- Error handling middleware can be customized for different route groups and error types
- Validation middleware prevents invalid data from reaching route handlers

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Today I learned advanced middleware patterns that go beyond basic logging. Understanding route-level middleware and chaining gives me precise control over request processing. These concepts are crucial for building secure, validated APIs with proper error handling.

---

📌 **Up Next:** Connecting Express to MongoDB and learning about `.env` usage and secure configuration.



---

## 📅 Day 11 - Connecting Express with MongoDB & Environment Configuration (July 5, 2025)

Today's focus was on integrating the backend Express server with a MongoDB database using **Mongoose**, and learning how to manage environment variables using `.env` files securely and efficiently.

---

### 🔌 Topics Covered:
- Installing and importing `mongoose`
- Connecting to MongoDB from Express using Mongoose
- Organizing the MongoDB connection logic into a separate config file
- Managing environment variables with `dotenv`
- Using `.env` file to hide sensitive credentials like database URL or JWT secret

---

### 🧪 Practical Experiments:
- Installed Mongoose:
  ```bash
  npm install mongoose
  ```

- Created a `config/db.js` file:
  ```js
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');

  const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
      await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
      console.log("MongoDB connected successfully");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("MongoDB connection failed:", err);
    }
  };

  module.exports = connectDB;
  ```

- Used it in `index.js`:
  ```js
  require('dotenv').config();
  const connectDB = require('./config/db');
  connectDB();
  ```

- Created `.env` file:
  ```env
  PORT=5000
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mymernapp
  ```

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- `dotenv` helps keep sensitive data like DB URIs or secret keys out of codebase and public repos.
- Mongoose simplifies MongoDB queries and schema modeling.
- Keeping config logic in a separate file helps keep `index.js` clean and improves reusability.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Now my Express server can communicate securely with MongoDB, and all sensitive credentials are stored in `.env` files, making my application more secure and professional.

---

📌 **Up Next:** Working with Mongoose schemas and creating models for users and posts.


---

## 📅 Day 12 - Creating Mongoose Models & Understanding Schema Design (July 8, 2025)

Today I explored how to define MongoDB document structure using **Mongoose schemas** and how to create reusable models. This was a crucial step to bring structure and validation into MongoDB operations, which otherwise stores documents with a flexible schema.

---

### 📘 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Schema in MongoDB using Mongoose
- Creating schemas and defining field types
- Adding validation rules like `required`, `default`, and `enum`
- Creating and exporting models for use in Express routes

---

### 🛠️ Hands-On Implementation:

Created a schema for a `User` model:

```js
// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 3,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['user', 'admin'],
    default: 'user',
  },
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

Used the model inside a controller:

```js
const User = require('../models/User');

const registerUser = async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  const newUser = new User({ name, email, password });

  try {
    await newUser.save();
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
  }
};
```

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Mongoose lets us enforce structure in MongoDB using schemas, making code more reliable and maintainable.
- Validations like `required`, `unique`, and `enum` are handled automatically before saving to the database.
- Schemas can be extended easily, and models are reusable throughout the project.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Successfully created a clean and reusable `User` model with validations. I now understand how to design schemas and interact with them through Express endpoints.

---

📌 **Up Next:** Setting up API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) documents using Mongoose.



---

## 📅 Day 13 - Building CRUD APIs with Express & Mongoose (July 9, 2025)

Today was all about mastering the full CRUD cycle — **Create, Read, Update, Delete** — using **Express.js** and **Mongoose**. This solidified my understanding of how backend servers interact with databases and how to create RESTful APIs in real-world apps.

---

### 📘 Topics Covered:
- Creating RESTful routes using Express
- Using Mongoose methods: `.save()`, `.find()`, `.findById()`, `.findByIdAndUpdate()`, `.findByIdAndDelete()`
- Handling errors and sending appropriate HTTP status codes
- Structuring route handlers in controller files

---

### 🛠️ Hands-On Implementation:

Created a full set of API endpoints for a `Product` model.

```js
// models/Product.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  price: Number,
  description: String
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);
```

```js
// routes/productRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Product = require('../models/Product');

// CREATE
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newProduct = new Product(req.body);
    const saved = await newProduct.save();
    res.status(201).json(saved);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});

// READ ALL
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const products = await Product.find();
  res.status(200).json(products);
});

// READ ONE
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const product = await Product.findById(req.params.id);
  res.status(200).json(product);
});

// UPDATE
router.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const updated = await Product.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { new: true });
  res.status(200).json(updated);
});

// DELETE
router.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  await Product.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
  res.status(204).send();
});
```

Connected routes to the main server:

```js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const productRoutes = require('./routes/productRoutes');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api/products', productRoutes);

// MongoDB connection here...
```

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- CRUD operations are the backbone of any backend server logic.
- Cleanly separating routes and models improves project structure.
- Returning proper status codes (`200`, `201`, `400`, `204`, etc.) improves API usability and debugging.
- Mongoose methods like `.findByIdAndUpdate()` and `.findByIdAndDelete()` simplify operations a lot.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Completed a full CRUD system for product management. I now understand how frontend apps (like React) can communicate with backend APIs to manage dynamic data.

---

📌 **Up Next:** Learn about middleware in Express — especially `express.json()`, custom error handling, and route protection.



---

## 📅 Day 14 - Exploring Middleware & Error Handling in Express (July 10, 2025)

Today's focus was on understanding how **middleware** works in Express.js and how to implement **error handling** mechanisms effectively. Middleware is one of the most powerful features of Express, enabling request pre-processing, validation, authentication, and logging.

---

### 📘 Topics Covered:
- What is middleware in Express?
- Types of middleware: built-in, third-party, and custom
- Using `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`
- Creating custom middleware functions
- Error-handling middleware
- Order of middleware execution
- Handling 404 Not Found errors and sending consistent error responses

### 🔁 Middleware Breakdown

Learned how middleware functions are executed in order and can either pass control to the next middleware or end the request.

```js
// Built-in middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Custom middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request received at ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware
});
```

### ❌ Error-Handling Middleware

Used a separate function at the end of all routes to handle unexpected errors and send consistent error responses.

```js
// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Error:', err.message);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong', message: err.message });
});
```

Also added a generic 404 handler for unmatched routes:

```js
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ error: 'Route not found' });
});
```

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Middleware is just a function that has access to `req`, `res`, and `next()`.
- `express.json()` is needed to parse incoming JSON payloads (especially for POST requests).
- Custom middleware allows us to apply logic like authentication, logging, or rate limiting.
- Placing error-handling middleware at the end ensures proper fallback for unhandled exceptions.
- Order of middleware is critical — the request flows top to bottom.

---

### ✅ Outcome:
Now I understand how Express apps are structured using layers of middleware and how to handle both expected and unexpected errors gracefully. This makes applications more maintainable and debuggable.

---

📌 **Up Next:** Integrating authentication using JWTs and protecting routes with middleware.



---

## 📅 Day 15 - Implementing JWT Authentication in Express (July 11, 2025)

Today's goal was to learn how to **secure Express routes using JWT (JSON Web Token)**. This involved understanding token creation, verification, and using middleware to protect API endpoints.

---

### 🔐 What is JWT?

JWT stands for **JSON Web Token** – a compact, URL-safe token used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It’s commonly used for authentication in RESTful APIs.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- `jsonwebtoken` package
- `dotenv` for environment variables
- Express middleware to protect routes

---

### 🧪 Steps Practiced:

1. **Installing JWT package:**
   ```bash
   npm install jsonwebtoken dotenv
   ```

2. **Generating a JWT token:**
   ```js
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
   ```

3. **Sending the token to the client upon login:**
   ```js
   res.json({ token });
   ```

4. **Creating middleware to verify token:**
   ```js
   const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
     const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
     const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];

     if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);

     jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
       if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
       req.user = user;
       next();
     });
   };
   ```

5. **Protecting routes using this middleware:**
   ```js
   app.get('/dashboard', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
     res.json({ message: "Welcome to the dashboard!", user: req.user });
   });
   ```

---

### 🔑 Key Learnings:

- JWTs are a stateless way to implement authentication, which works well with REST APIs.
- Tokens are signed with a secret and include a payload (user info), a header, and a signature.
- Authentication middleware ensures only authorized users can access protected routes.
- Environment variables (`.env`) are used to store sensitive info like the `JWT_SECRET`.
- Best practice is to include tokens in the `Authorization` header using the "Bearer" scheme.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

I can now implement a basic authentication system in Node.js using JWT. I learned how to protect routes and verify tokens, making the API more secure.

---

📌 **Next Target:** Connect this JWT auth system with the frontend (React) to build a complete login-protected flow.

## 📅 Day 16 - React Context API Setup: Building Todo App Foundation (July 12, 2025)

Today I started building a **Todo application** using React Context API. This was homework, and I began by setting up the project structure and understanding how Context API works for state management across components.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Set up a new Vite React project for Todo app
- Understand React Context API for state management
- Create the basic project structure with contexts folder
- Build the foundation for todo management

---

### 🛠️ Project Setup:

1. **Created React project with Vite:**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest 10toDoContextLocal -- --template react
   cd 10toDoContextLocal
   npm install
   ```

2. **Installed dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Project structure created:**
   ```
   src/
     ├── App.jsx
     ├── main.jsx  
     ├── contexts/
     │   └── toDoContext.js
     └── components/
         ├── TodoForm.jsx
         └── TodoItem.jsx
   ```

---

### 🧠 Context API Foundation:

Started understanding how Context API works as an alternative to prop drilling for state management in React applications.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully set up the todo project structure
- Prepared for implementing Context API for state management
- Ready to build todo functionality in next session

---

📌 **Next Target:** Implement todo Context with state management and custom hooks.


---

## 📅 Day 17 - React Context Implementation: TodoContext with Custom Hooks (July 14, 2025)

Today I implemented the **TodoContext** with custom hooks for managing todo state throughout the application. This was the core homework where I learned how Context API provides a powerful alternative to prop drilling.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Create TodoContext for centralized state management
- Implement custom hooks for todo operations
- Understand Provider pattern and context consumption
- Set up the foundation for todo CRUD operations

---

### 🛠️ Context Implementation:

1. **TodoContext with custom hooks (contexts/toDoContext.js):**
   ```jsx
   import { createContext, useContext } from "react";

   export const TodoContext = createContext({
       todos: [
           {
               id: 1,
               todo: "Todo msg",
               completed: false,
           }
       ],
       addTodo: (todo) => {},
       updateTodo: (id, todo) => {},
       deleteTodo: (id) => {},
       toggleComplete: (id) => {}
   })

   export const useTodo = () => {
       return useContext(TodoContext);
   }

   export const TodoProvider = TodoContext.Provider;
   ```

2. **Understanding Context Structure:**
   - Defined the context with default values for todos array and functions
   - Created custom hook `useTodo` for easy context consumption
   - Exported `TodoProvider` for wrapping components

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **Context API** eliminates the need for prop drilling
- **Custom hooks** make context consumption cleaner and reusable
- **Provider pattern** allows sharing state across component tree
- Default context values serve as both documentation and fallbacks

---

### 🧩 Key Insights:

- Context should define the shape of data and functions clearly
- Custom hooks abstract away `useContext` complexity
- Provider will wrap the App component to share todo state

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully created TodoContext with proper structure
- Implemented custom hook for context consumption
- Ready to integrate context with actual state management
- Understanding of how Context API scales for larger applications

---

📌 **Next Target:** Integrate Context with App component and implement useState for actual state management.
         <input
           type="text"
           placeholder="Name"
           value={name}
           onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
         />
         <input
           type="email"
           placeholder="Email"
           value={email}
           onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
         />
         <textarea
           placeholder="Message"
           value={message}
           onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
         />
         <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Managing Complex State (Objects):**
   ```jsx
   function UserProfile() {
     const [user, setUser] = useState({
       name: '',
       age: '',
       city: ''
     });

     const handleInputChange = (field, value) => {
       setUser(prevUser => ({
         ...prevUser,
         [field]: value
       }));
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <input
           placeholder="Name"
           onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('name', e.target.value)}
         />
         <input
           placeholder="Age"
           onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('age', e.target.value)}
         />
         <input
           placeholder="City"
           onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('city', e.target.value)}
         />
         <div>
           <h3>User Info:</h3>
           <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
           <p>Age: {user.age}</p>
           <p>City: {user.city}</p>
         </div>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Toggle Functionality:**
   ```jsx
   function TodoItem({ todo }) {
     const [isCompleted, setIsCompleted] = useState(false);
     const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);

     return (
       <div>
         <input
           type="checkbox"
           checked={isCompleted}
           onChange={() => setIsCompleted(!isCompleted)}
         />
         <span style={{ textDecoration: isCompleted ? 'line-through' : 'none' }}>
           {todo}
         </span>
         <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(!isEditing)}>
           {isEditing ? 'Save' : 'Edit'}
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **State** is data that changes over time and affects what the user sees
- `useState` returns an array with current state value and a setter function
- State updates are **asynchronous** and cause the component to re-render
- When updating object state, always use spread operator to maintain immutability
- Event handlers like `onClick` and `onChange` make components interactive

---

### 🧩 Challenges Faced:

- Understanding why direct state mutation doesn't work (`state.push()` vs `setState([...state, newItem])`)
- Learning to prevent default form submission with `e.preventDefault()`
- Handling controlled vs uncontrolled components properly

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Built interactive components that respond to user input
- Created a functional contact form with state management
- Implemented toggle functionality for todo items
- Understood the concept of controlled components in React

---

📌 **Next Target:** Learn useEffect hook for side effects and API calls.


---

## 📅 Day 18 - App Component Integration: useState with Context Provider (July 15, 2025)

Today I implemented the main **App.jsx** component by integrating Context Provider with useState for actual todo state management and localStorage persistence.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Integrate TodoProvider with useState for real state management
- Implement localStorage for todo persistence
- Connect all todo CRUD operations in App component
- Use useEffect for loading todos from localStorage

---

### 🛠️ App Component Implementation:

1. **App.jsx with Context Provider and State:**
   ```jsx
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
   import { TodoProvider } from './contexts/toDoContext'
   import './App.css'
   import TodoForm from './components/TodoForm'
   import TodoItem from './components/TodoItem'

   function App() {
     const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])

     const addTodo = (todo) => {
       setTodos((prev) => [{ id: Date.now(), ...todo }, ...prev])
     }

     const updateTodo = (id, todo) => {
       setTodos((prev) => prev.map((prevTodo) => 
         prevTodo.id === id ? todo : prevTodo))
     }

     const deleteTodo = (id) => {
       setTodos((prev) => prev.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id))
     }

     const toggleComplete = (id) => {
       setTodos((prev) => 
         prev.map((prevTodo) => 
           prevTodo.id === id 
             ? { ...prevTodo, completed: !prevTodo.completed } 
             : prevTodo))
     }

     // Load todos from localStorage
     useEffect(() => {
       const todos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todos"))
       if (todos && todos.length > 0) {
         setTodos(todos)
       }
     }, [])

     // Save todos to localStorage
     useEffect(() => {
       localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(todos))
     }, [todos])

     return (
       <TodoProvider value={{todos, addTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo, toggleComplete}}>
         <div className="bg-[#172842] min-h-screen py-8">
           <div className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto shadow-md rounded-lg px-4 py-3 text-white">
             <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-8 mt-2">
               Manage Your Todos
             </h1>
             <div className="mb-4">
               <TodoForm />
             </div>
             <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-y-3">
               {todos.map((todo) => (
                 <div key={todo.id} className='w-full'>
                   <TodoItem todo={todo} />
                 </div>
               ))}
             </div>
           </div>
         </div>
       </TodoProvider>
     )
   }

   export default App
   ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **Context Provider** passes actual state and functions to child components
- **useState** manages the todos array with CRUD operations
- **useEffect** handles localStorage sync for persistence
- **Functional state updates** prevent stale closure issues
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling

---

### 🧩 Key Implementation Details:

- Used `Date.now()` for unique todo IDs
- Implemented immutable state updates with spread operator
- Two useEffect hooks: one for loading, one for saving
- Provider value prop passes all context functions

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully integrated Context Provider with real state management
- Implemented localStorage persistence for todos
- Created responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Ready to build TodoForm and TodoItem components

---

📌 **Next Target:** Build TodoForm component with form handling and context integration.
             <h3>{post.title}</h3>
             <p>{post.body}</p>
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **useEffect** handles side effects - operations that affect other components or can't happen during rendering
- **Dependency array** controls when effects run:
  - No array: runs after every render
  - Empty array `[]`: runs once after first render
  - With dependencies `[dep1, dep2]`: runs when dependencies change
- **Cleanup functions** prevent memory leaks by cleaning up subscriptions, timers, etc.
- Effects run **after** the render is committed to the screen
- Multiple effects can be used to separate concerns

---

### 🧩 Challenges Faced:

- Understanding when to include variables in the dependency array
- Debugging infinite re-render loops caused by missing dependencies
- Learning the difference between `useEffect` and event handlers

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully fetched data from APIs using useEffect
- Implemented proper loading and error states
- Created components that clean up after themselves
- Built a foundation for making React apps that work with external data

---

📌 **Next Target:** Learn React Router for navigation and creating multi-page applications.

---

### 🎯 Objective:
Make the upload system more secure and controlled by adding restrictions on:
- File type (only images)
- File size
- Destination folder structure

---

### 🔧 Backend Improvements (Node.js + Express + Multer):

1. **File Type Validation:**
   ```js
   const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
     const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/jpg'];
     if (allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
       cb(null, true);
     } else {
       cb(new Error('Only JPG and PNG images are allowed'), false);
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Size Limit in Multer Configuration:**
   ```js
   const upload = multer({
     storage: storage,
     limits: { fileSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 2MB limit
     fileFilter: fileFilter
   });
   ```

3. **Handled Multer Errors Gracefully:**
   ```js
   app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
     upload.single('file')(req, res, function (err) {
       if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
         return res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
       } else if (err) {
         return res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
       }
       res.status(200).json({ message: 'File uploaded', file: req.file });
     });
   });
   ```

---

### ⚛️ Frontend Improvements (React):

- Alert user when file exceeds size or isn't an image.
- Used simple conditional checks before submitting:
  ```js
  if (!file.type.startsWith("image/")) {
    alert("Please upload a valid image.");
    return;
  }
  if (file.size > 2 * 1024 * 1024) {
    alert("Image should be less than 2MB.");
    return;
  }
  ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- `file.mimetype` is crucial for backend-side type checking.
- How Multer limits and filters work.
- How to gracefully handle and display errors to the frontend.
- Proper separation of concerns by validating on both client and server.

---

### 🧩 Challenges Tackled:

- Frontend `file.size` wasn’t matching backend size limit exactly (due to unit confusion).
- Some older browsers don't show `file.type`, added fallback checks.
- Creating separate `uploads/images/` directory for organizing content.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

I now have a **robust file upload system** that:
- Accepts only valid images
- Rejects oversized or incorrect files
- Handles errors cleanly
- Stores files in an organized manner

---

📌 **Next Goal:**
Store file metadata in MongoDB and build a UI to display uploaded images dynamically.


---

## 📅 Day 19 - TodoForm Component: Form Handling with Context (July 16, 2025)

Today I built the **TodoForm component** that handles form submission and integrates with the TodoContext to add new todos. This was homework focusing on form handling and context consumption.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Create TodoForm component with controlled inputs
- Integrate with TodoContext using useTodo hook
- Handle form submission and input validation
- Implement form reset after successful submission

---

### 🛠️ TodoForm Implementation:

1. **TodoForm Component (components/TodoForm.jsx):**
   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react'
   import { useTodo } from '../contexts/toDoContext'; 

   function TodoForm() {
       const [todo, setTodo] = useState("")
       const { addTodo } = useTodo()

       const add = (e) => {
           e.preventDefault()
           
           if (!todo) return
           
           addTodo({ todo, completed: false })
           setTodo("")
       }

       return (
           <form onSubmit={add} className="flex">
               <input
                   type="text"
                   placeholder="Write Todo..."
                   className="w-full border border-black/10 rounded-l-lg px-3 outline-none duration-150 bg-white/20 py-1.5"
                   value={todo}
                   onChange={(e) => setTodo(e.target.value)}
               />
               <button 
                   type="submit" 
                   className="rounded-r-lg px-3 py-1 bg-green-600 text-white shrink-0"
               >
                   Add
               </button>
           </form>
       )
   }

   export default TodoForm
   ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **Controlled components** keep form state in React component
- **useTodo hook** provides clean access to context functions
- **Form validation** prevents empty todo submission
- **Form reset** clears input after successful submission
- **Tailwind classes** for responsive form styling

---

### 🧩 Key Implementation Details:

- Used `useState` for controlled input handling
- `e.preventDefault()` prevents page reload on form submission
- Input validation ensures non-empty todos
- Form styling with Tailwind CSS for professional look
- `shrink-0` prevents button from shrinking on small screens

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully built functional TodoForm component
- Integrated form with Context API for state management
- Implemented proper form validation and reset
- Created responsive form UI with Tailwind CSS

---

📌 **Next Target:** Build TodoItem component with edit, delete, and toggle functionality.
             <NavLink 
               to="/contact" 
               className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'active' : ''}
             >
               Contact
             </NavLink>
           </li>
         </ul>
       </nav>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Routes with Parameters:**
   ```jsx
   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

   // In App.js
   <Route path="/user/:userId" element={<UserProfile />} />
   <Route path="/product/:productId" element={<ProductDetails />} />

   // UserProfile component
   function UserProfile() {
     const { userId } = useParams();
     const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`)
         .then(res => res.json())
         .then(setUser);
     }, [userId]);

     return (
       <div>
         {user ? (
           <div>
             <h1>{user.name}</h1>
             <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
             <p>Phone: {user.phone}</p>
           </div>
         ) : (
           <div>Loading user...</div>
         )}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Nested Routes:**
   ```jsx
   import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

   // Parent component
   function Dashboard() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Dashboard</h1>
         <nav>
           <Link to="/dashboard/profile">Profile</Link>
           <Link to="/dashboard/settings">Settings</Link>
           <Link to="/dashboard/analytics">Analytics</Link>
         </nav>
         <Outlet /> {/* Child routes render here */}
       </div>
     );
   }

   // In App.js
   <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
     <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
     <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
     <Route path="analytics" element={<Analytics />} />
   </Route>
   ```

5. **Programmatic Navigation:**
   ```jsx
   import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

   function LoginForm() {
     const navigate = useNavigate();
     const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
     const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

     const handleSubmit = (e) => {
       e.preventDefault();
       // Simulate login
       if (email && password) {
         // Redirect to dashboard after successful login
         navigate('/dashboard');
       } else {
         alert('Please enter email and password');
       }
     };

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <input
           type="email"
           placeholder="Email"
           value={email}
           onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
         />
         <input
           type="password"
           placeholder="Password"
           value={password}
           onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
         />
         <button type="submit">Login</button>
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```

6. **Protected Routes:**
   ```jsx
   function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
     const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
     
     return isAuthenticated ? children : <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
   }

   // Usage in App.js
   <Route 
     path="/dashboard" 
     element={
       <ProtectedRoute>
         <Dashboard />
       </ProtectedRoute>
     } 
   />
   ```

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **Client-side routing** allows navigation without page reloads
- `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` prevent default browser navigation and use React Router instead
- **URL parameters** (`/user/:id`) make dynamic routes that can display different content
- `useNavigate` hook allows programmatic navigation (redirects after form submissions)
- **Nested routes** enable complex UI structures with parent-child relationships
- **Protected routes** can conditionally render based on authentication status

---

### 🧩 Challenges Faced:

- Understanding the difference between `<Link>` and regular `<a>` tags
- Learning when to use `useParams`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation` hooks
- Setting up nested routes correctly with `<Outlet>`
- Handling 404 pages with catch-all routes (`path="*"`)

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Built a multi-page React application with proper navigation
- Implemented dynamic routes that fetch data based on URL parameters
- Created protected routes for authenticated users only
- Understood how to structure complex applications with nested routing

---

📌 **Next Target:** Learn React Context API and state management patterns.

## 📅 Day 20 - TodoItem Component: Edit, Delete, Toggle Functionality (July 17, 2025)

Today I built the **TodoItem component** that handles individual todo operations including edit mode, delete, and toggle completion. This was the most complex component requiring multiple state management and context integration.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Create TodoItem component with inline editing capability
- Implement delete and toggle completion functionality
- Handle edit mode toggle and form validation
- Style todo items with conditional rendering

---

### 🛠️ TodoItem Implementation:

1. **TodoItem Component (components/TodoItem.jsx):**
   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react'
   import { useTodo } from '../contexts/toDoContext';

   function TodoItem({ todo }) {
       const [isTodoEditable, setIsTodoEditable] = useState(false)
       const [todoMsg, setTodoMsg] = useState(todo.todo)
       const { updateTodo, deleteTodo, toggleComplete } = useTodo()

       const editTodo = () => {
           updateTodo(todo.id, { ...todo, todo: todoMsg })
           setIsTodoEditable(false)
       }
       
       const toggleCompleted = () => {
           toggleComplete(todo.id)
       }

       return (
           <div className={`flex border border-black/10 rounded-lg px-3 py-1.5 gap-x-3 shadow-sm duration-300 text-black ${todo.completed ? "bg-[#c6e9a7]" : "bg-[#ccbed7]"}`}>
               <input
                   type="checkbox"
                   className="cursor-pointer"
                   checked={todo.completed}
                   onChange={toggleCompleted}
               />
               <input
                   type="text"
                   className={`border outline-none w-full bg-transparent rounded-lg ${isTodoEditable ? "border-black/10 px-2" : "border-transparent"} ${todo.completed ? "line-through" : ""}`}
                   value={todoMsg}
                   onChange={(e) => setTodoMsg(e.target.value)}
                   readOnly={!isTodoEditable}
               />
               <button
                   className="inline-flex w-8 h-8 rounded-lg text-sm border border-black/10 justify-center items-center bg-gray-50 hover:bg-gray-100 shrink-0 disabled:opacity-50"
                   onClick={() => {
                       if (todo.completed) return;

                       if (isTodoEditable) {
                           editTodo();
                       } else setIsTodoEditable((prev) => !prev);
                   }}
                   disabled={todo.completed}
               >
                   {isTodoEditable ? "📁" : "✏️"}
               </button>
               <button
                   className="inline-flex w-8 h-8 rounded-lg text-sm border border-black/10 justify-center items-center bg-gray-50 hover:bg-gray-100 shrink-0"
                   onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}
               >
                   ❌
               </button>
           </div>
       )
   }

   export default TodoItem
   ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **Local state** for edit mode and temporary input value
- **Conditional styling** based on completion status
- **Disabled states** prevent editing completed todos
- **Multiple context functions** in single component
- **Complex conditional rendering** for edit/view modes

---

### 🧩 Key Implementation Details:

- `isTodoEditable` state controls edit mode toggle
- `todoMsg` holds temporary value during editing
- Conditional background colors for completed vs pending todos
- Button icons change based on edit mode
- `readOnly` attribute controls input editability

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Successfully built fully functional TodoItem component
- Implemented inline editing with proper state management
- Created intuitive UI with visual feedback for different states
- Completed the full todo application with all CRUD operations

---

📌 **Next Target:** Review complete todo app functionality and prepare for backend integration topics.

3. **Static Serving for Uploaded Files:**
   ```js
   app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
   ```

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- How to use `useEffect` and `useState` hooks effectively for API calls.
- Dynamic rendering in React using `map()` to generate components based on data.
- Served static assets (images/files) from Express to React via correct pathing.
- Importance of relative URLs and CORS policies while working with separate frontend/backend.

---

### 🧩 Challenges Faced:

- Forgot to prepend `/uploads/` to the file path, which initially caused broken image links.
- CORS error while fetching files from backend – resolved by using the `cors` package.
- Some files didn’t load properly because of incorrect MIME type handling; added conditionals.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- A fully functional **File Gallery Component** in React that lists all uploaded files from MongoDB.
- Clean and responsive UI with basic details like name, size, type, and preview.
- Laid the groundwork for future improvements such as file filters, search, and delete options.

---

📌 **Next Goal:**
Add a **file upload feature** directly from the frontend using `axios` or `fetch`, integrating with the existing backend `/upload` route.

---

## 📅 Day 21 – Complete Todo App with localStorage Integration (July 18, 2025)

Today I completed the todo application by fully integrating localStorage persistence and testing all functionality. This homework demonstrated a complete React application using Context API, hooks, and browser storage.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Test complete todo application functionality
- Verify localStorage persistence across browser sessions
- Review Context API implementation and component architecture
- Understand modern React patterns used in the project

---

### 🛠️ Complete Application Features:

1. **Full CRUD Operations Working:**
   - ✅ **Create:** Add new todos via TodoForm
   - ✅ **Read:** Display todos from context state
   - ✅ **Update:** Edit todos inline in TodoItem
   - ✅ **Delete:** Remove todos with delete button

2. **localStorage Integration:**
   ```jsx
   // Loading todos on app start
   useEffect(() => {
       const todos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todos"))
       if (todos && todos.length > 0) {
           setTodos(todos)
       }
   }, [])

   // Saving todos whenever state changes
   useEffect(() => {
       localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(todos))
   }, [todos])
   ```

3. **Context API Architecture:**
   - **TodoContext:** Centralized state management
   - **useTodo Hook:** Clean context consumption
   - **TodoProvider:** State sharing across components

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- **Persistent state management** with localStorage
- **Component composition** with Context Provider pattern
- **Custom hooks** for cleaner code organization
- **Conditional styling** and state-dependent UI
- **Modern React patterns** without external state libraries

---

### 🧩 Key Technical Insights:

- Context API is excellent for small to medium apps
- localStorage provides simple client-side persistence
- Functional components with hooks are more concise
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development
- Component separation improves maintainability

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Built complete, functional todo application
- Implemented persistent storage without backend
- Demonstrated mastery of React Context API
- Created professional UI with Tailwind CSS
- Ready to move to full-stack integration

---

📌 **Next Target:** Start MegaBlog project to learn frontend-backend integration with authentication.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- How `FormData` is used to send binary files in HTTP requests.
- `upload.single("file")` is essential to match the key name from the frontend.
- React file inputs need local state handling for file selection.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced:

- Initially named the form key incorrectly (`formData.append('upload', file)` instead of `'file'`).
- Axios was not sending `Content-Type` correctly; resolved by letting `FormData` set it automatically.
- Had to verify backend received file using `console.log(req.file)`.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Created a fully working **file upload form** in React.
- Verified file storage in `/uploads` folder and metadata in MongoDB.
- Achieved a complete full-stack file upload system!

---

📌 **Next Goal:**
Start working on **user authentication** so that uploads can be tied to specific users, with login/signup via JWT.


---

## 📅 Day 22 – MegaBlog Project Setup: React + Appwrite + Redux Toolkit (July 19, 2025)

           } catch (error) {
               console.log("Appwrite service :: logout :: error", error);
           }
       }
   }

   const authService = new AuthService();
   export default authService;
   ```

---

---

## 📅 Day 23 – MegaBlog: React Components & Appwrite CRUD Operations (July 21, 2025)

Today I built the complete **MegaBlog frontend** with React components and implemented full CRUD operations using Appwrite. This included authentication UI, blog post management, file uploads, and rich text editing with TinyMCE.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

- Build authentication components (Login, Signup, Header)
- Implement Appwrite database service for blog posts
- Create CRUD operations for blog management
- Integrate file upload functionality with Appwrite Storage

       useEffect(() => {
           appwriteService.getPosts().then((posts) => {
               if (posts) {
                   setPosts(posts.documents);
               }
           });
       }, []);

       if (posts.length === 0) {
           return (
               <div className="w-full py-8 mt-4 text-center">
                   <div className="flex flex-wrap">
